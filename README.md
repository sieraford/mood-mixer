# Mood Mixer

## Description

Mood Mixer displays 8 different gifs that correspond to 8 different moods or emotions. The user is then able to select one of the gifs that they relate to the most in that moment, which then directs them to another page that lists 5 different playlists for them to choose from based on the mood they selected. If they decide that they want to see playlists for another mood, then they can simply click the “Go Back” button below the list of playlists and try again.
